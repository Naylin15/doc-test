Getting Started
===============

The Flyve MDM plugin for GLPI integrates the intuitive and outstanding features of Flyve MDM into GLPI platform providing you the security functionality for your IT infrastructure.

As GLPI is a Free Asset and IT Management Software package, we wanted to provide a plugin that helps you to keep control of your mobile devices, here we'll guide you in the steps to manage your mobile fleet from the basics.

Enrolling Agents
----------------

In order to add the devices to your fleet, you must invite the owner of the device to enroll by sending him an email.

* Go to the Invitations section
* Click on the "+" button
* Write the email of the user whose device you'll control
* Click on Add

The invitation will have the status pending until the user enrolls the device.

.. note::

   Users must have installed in their devices the Android or iOS Agent, see these links for more information:

    * `Android MDM Agent - Getting started <http://flyve.org/android-mdm-agent/howtos/getting-started>`_.
    * `iOS MDM Agent - Getting started <http://flyve.org/ios-mdm-agent/howtos/getting-started>`_.

After enrollment, the device will be displayed on the Agent section.

Create your Fleet
-----------------

You must create a new fleet since the "not managed fleet" is the default one and therefore comes locked.

.. warning::

In order to create it, you only have to follow these steps:

* Click in the "+" button on the Fleet section
* Name it and Click on add.
