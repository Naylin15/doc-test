Getting Started
===============

The Flyve MDM plugin for GLPI integrates the intuitive and outstanding features of Flyve MDM into GLPI platform providing you the security functionality for your IT infrastructure.

As GLPI is a Free Asset and IT Management Software package, we wanted to provide a plugin that helps you to keep control of your mobile devices, here we'll guide you in the steps to manage your mobile fleet from the basics.

Enrolling Agents
----------------

In order to add the devices to your fleet, you must invite the owner of the device to enroll by sending him an email.

Go to the Invitations section, click on the "+" button and write the email of the user whose device you'll control.

Automatically it will appear to you on the *Pending Invitations* until the user enrolls the device.

.. note::

   Users must have installed in their devices the Android or iOS Agent, see these links for more information:

    * `Android MDM Agent <http://flyve.org/android-mdm-agent/>`_.
    * `iOS MDM Agent <http://flyve.org/ios-mdm-agent/>`_.

After enrollment, the device will be displayed on the Agent section, you can from there on:

* Assign the Agent to a fleet
* Get the Inventory
* Geolocate the device

Create your Fleet
-----------------

You must create a new fleet since the "not managed fleet" is the default one and therefore comes locked.

.. warning::
   Carefull, be sure to not delete it since it will bring you some problems.

In order to create it, you only have to click in the "+" button on the Fleet section, name it and click on add.

To add the policies go to the Fleets section and select your Fleet by clicking on it, with the left side menu you can add all the policies your fleet requires.
